The MHP also has the capacity to do diabetes education via telemedicine and diabetic retinopathy screening using a non mydriatic camera. This program uses state-of-the-art technology, including telemedicine to provide blindness prevention services to uninsured people with diabetes. Since 2003, approximately 225 uninsured women have received prenatal care for the whole family in an innovative Group Prenatal Care project; this is a cost-effective way to provide excellent prenatal care to women and their babies who might otherwise receive none. In collaboration with Family Medicine residents and faculty from the UA College of Medicine, the MHP staff provides prenatal care, counseling and prenatal and postpartum health education. Pregnant mothers will deliver at the Banner University Medical Center. \n",
