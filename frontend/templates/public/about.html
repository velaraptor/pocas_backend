                        Based out of Austin TX, MHP Portal was developed as a brain child
                        between two childhood friends from a border town in South Texas.
                        Dr. Gomez was finishing his residency at University of Arizona when he noticed
                        how difficult it was to get the right services to patients
                        during his rural, mobile, and clinical rotations –
                        At that moment MHP Portal was conceived.
                        With experience in the medical field, legislative work, and the tech world,
                        we bring a unique expertise to iterate quickly to generate applications
                        to optimize physicians workloads, but also use that data to help
                        policymakers help underrepresented communities.

                        Our vision is to revolutionize the healthcare industry by bridging the gap between
                        social determinants of health (SDOH) data and existing healthcare services.
                        With our innovative solution, we aim to fast-track SDOH data into existing healthcare services,
                        providing healthcare providers with the tools they need to better understand and
                        address their patients’ health needs.
                        <br><br>
                        At the heart of our vision is the belief that SDOH data has the potential to
                        revolutionize the way healthcare is delivered. By making this data more accessible and usable,
                        we are helping healthcare providers to provide more personalized, patient-centered care.
                        <br><br>
                        Join us in our mission to make healthcare more effective, efficient, and accessible.
                        With MHP Portal, you can be a part of the change!
